## DO NOT USE UNTIL THIS MESSAGE IS GONE, THIS FORK IS NOT READY !!!
The Slider have been tested now and is working, but need adjustement.
Use now at your own risk.

## Project Diva Controller (Switch)

This repo is a fork from the [fluffymadness/ATMega32U4-Switch-Fightstick repo](https://github.com/fluffymadness/ATMega32U4-Switch-Fightstick)
made to create a custom Arcade Controller for Hatsune Miku: Project Diva Mega39's/MegaMix that use the Dedicated Arcade Controller mode like the official HORI controller.

You'll need the exact same hardware and libraries as the original repo (+ The [Quick MPR121 library, by SomewhatLurker](https://github.com/somewhatlurker/QuickMpr121) ) , and a Slider using the MPR121 module. (should use 3 of theme for 32 sensors.)

(Hatsune Miku: Project Diva Future Tone (Japanese ver only) is also supported if you can convert the controller Switch to PS4 using adapter or other solutions, even using Remote Play with DS4Emulator on both PS4 and PS5)

Thanks to [Somewhatlurker](https://github.com/somewhatlurker), [Dogtopus](https://github.com/dogtopus/), [TheCorrellRoyHD](https://twitter.com/correllroy), [Zedamex](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZ-jUHyriPCuebtpx48MPdQ) for all the needed datas, informations, and help on developping this project.

## Switch Fightstick Code (Atmega32U4)

This one is a working switch fightstick sketch
flashable via Arduino IDE. I personally use it on a pro micro clone microcontroller that can be bought for 2-3$ on aliexpress. My motivation was to have a working solution for dirt-cheap easy source-able parts. Well here it is. 

The Code itself has proper Button-Debounce, and 3 Modes of input.

You can switch seamlessly between the 3 modes by pressing START+SELECT. 

- Digital Only
- Fake Analog (Digital Movement is mapped to L-Analog)
- Smash Ultimate Mode (Most-left button on the second row of a fight stick is used as a modifier key to decrease the range of the Analog stick, if held)

## Building Instructions

- Download Arduino IDE, 

- Download the Bounce2 Library inside the Arduino IDE
- Download Arduino Lufa from https://github.com/Palatis/Arduino-Lufa and follow the instructions on it's repository
- Build and Flash for your ATMEGA32U4 Board
- Have Fun
